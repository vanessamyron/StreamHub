DEADLINE: Sunday, February 6th, 11:59pm on Canvas (only one team member needs to submit)
1.   Project title
StreamHub, StreamBrew, StreamCube
2.  Brief overview of what you are proposing
We are proposing a chrome extension to manage your favorite Twitch and Mixer streamers. Users will receive notifications when their followed streamer goes online, what platform they’re on, and even what game they're playing. StreamHub will consolidate your favorite games and streamers into one easy to use button.

3. Motivation
Live streamers are being contracted out to multiple different streaming services such as Mixer or Twitch due to their popularity and consumer reach.  Because of this, viewers end up having to constantly track multiple websites to find out if their favorite streamer is streaming on another website. StreamHub solves this by giving the viewers a centralized location to track their favorite stream personalities.
 
4. Features to be implemented and types of users
All Users: 
Darkmode 
Setting pane on extensions homepage
Saved clip libraries 
For Watchers:
Notifications for when streamers go live 
Clickable window from extension to view current streams with data such as viewers, length of stream, game, and streamer
Custom sort methods of how one wants their list of active streams sorted (such as length of stream, viewer count, game, or streamer name)
For Streamers:
Notifications can be customized when going live so watchers can know what specifically is being streamed and ease communication.
Possible way to manually change game within the extension 
 
5. Risk / Challenges
Changing requirements can be a factor preventing the group from implementing all features.
Technical Risks can be a challenging factor.
Time limitations can also be a challenging factor in terms of 
In terms of implementing database security example password hashing can increase the complexity of the project.

6. Existing related projects
TwitchNow, TwitchTv, Now Streaming. These products all solely work with Twitch and don’t integrate or use Mixer at all. We plan on combining these to widen the target audience as well as create a master Chrome Extension to be used by users of both services and streamers of both services.

7. Intended platform / programming language
Google Chrome extension, HTML/CSS/Javascript for the front-end, Python for the back-end and API calls.
 
8. Third-party libraries / APIs to be used
Twitch API, Mixer API
 
9. Team members, expertise, project responsibilities, and team organization
List the team members, their FSU IDs, and each member’s expertise, such as the programming languages, databases, mobile programming, platforms, APIs, etc. each is comfortable with. Mention who will do what during the project. Mention also how your team will be organized (e.g., will you have a manager in charge of delegating tasks or will you decide together based on interests/skills?), what will be your communication like (will you use Slack, Canvas or something similar to communicate? How often will you meet in person?), etc.
